# Citibike in NYC Investor Presentation

## Purpose

The NYC citibike data allows us to see a fairly typical breakdown of a busy month for citibike's bikeshare program.

This presentation [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chris8392/viz/mod14_challenge/Story1?publish=yes) breaks down some important demographics and usage data from the month of August in order to prepare for a possible roll out in Des Moines Iowa.

We can expect similar usage and demo in Des Moines, though on a smaller scale.

## Results

Our findings show that citibike trips stay within the span of an hour with few exceptions that might be reasonably considered outliers and should therefore be ignored. This is exactly the expected use case for the product. The bikes are built to be easily accessed and abandoned.

Gender breakdown shows males to be more likely to take the bikes for any duration, though this too is an expected outcome. It is much easier for men to travel alone outside a car or train in a big city especially in the dark.

Trip starttimes are shown in the next graphic. This shows a clear increase in trips taken around 9am and 5pm. It is likely that there is a large base of users that take the bikes to and from work thus the 9-5 dip. This is further supported by the next graphic which shows that the weekends do not see this trend.

The next chart shows the same heatmap for each gender collected. It shows that womena and undefined also see this 9-5 split though it reinforces a need to market more effectively to women, or if possible to improve safety.

The next heatmap divides the data by user-type shows that the bulk of traffic on these bikes is done by subscribers. Lastly, its complementary graph shows that really only subscribers are using the bikes for commutes.
